# Test Suite

golox and loxfmt are tested against a suite of test files defined under [testdata](testdata).

golox is tested by running each test file and comparing the output with the expected output defined
in the file. golox with the -hints flag is also tested in the same way.

loxfmt is tested by formatting each test file and asserting that the contents of the file are
unchanged.

## Test File Format

Test files are regular Lox files containing comments which describe the expectations of the test:

- `// prints: <value>` defines a string that should be printed to stdout.
- `// error: <message>` defines an error message that should be printed to stderr.
- `// hint: <message>` defines a hint message that should be printed to stderr.

Both special comments can appear multiple times in a test file.

For example:

```lox
print 3 % 2; // prints: 1
print 3 % 3; // prints: 0
print 3.5 % 2; // prints: 1.5
print 3 % 1.5; // prints: 0
```

If a `// syntaxerror` comment appears at the start of a test file, the file will be not be formatted
or tested against golox with the -hints flag.

## Running the Tests

Run all tests:

```sh
make test
```

Run the golox or loxfmt tests individually:

```sh
make test_golox
make test_golox_hints
make test_loxfmt
```

Run a specific test:

```sh
make test_golox RUN=TestInterpreter/Number/Modulo
make test_golox_hints RUN=TestInterpreterHints/Number/Modulo
make test_loxfmt RUN=TestFormatter/Number/Modulo
```

## Updating the Test Expectations

The expectations of each test can be updated to match the current implementation by running either
of the following commands:

```sh
make update_golox_tests
make update_golox_hint_tests
make update_loxfmt_tests
```

As with running the tests, you can update the expectations of a specific test as well:

```sh
make update_golox_tests RUN=TestInterpreter/Number/Modulo
make update_golox_hint_tests RUN=TestInterpreterHints/Number/Modulo
make update_loxfmt_tests RUN=TestFormatter/Number/Modulo
```
